# In this exercise, you'll work with one of the most popular starter data sets in data science, the Titanic data set. 
# This is a data set that records various attributes of passengers on the Titanic, including who survived and who didn’t.

# Getting started
# Read the description of the data set on the Kaggle website.Download the data as an excel file here. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

# Exercise
# Using R, you’ll be handling missing values in this data set, and creating a new data set. Specifically, these are the tasks you need to do:



################
### 0: Load the data in RStudio
#Save the data set as a CSV file called titanic_original.csv and load it in RStudio into a data frame.

#loads R package -> dplyr
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))

#loads csv file into R & saved as data frame & StringsAsFactors=FALSE flag to force all factor to be a character.
titanicori <- data.frame(read.csv("titanic_original.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE))

#reads only 1309 rows of csv as automatic extra row is added at the bottom.
titanicori <- titanicori[0:1309, 0:14]




################
## 1: Port of embarkation
# The embarked column has one missing value, which is known to correspond to a passenger who actually embarked at Southampton. 
# Find the missing value and replace it with S.


#finds all missing value in that column and replace as NA
titanicori$embarked[titanicori$embarked==""]<- NA 

# to make sure our code works, finds which row has NA
which(is.na(titanicori$embarked))

# renames NA as 'S'
titanicori$embarked[is.na(titanicori$embarked)] <- 'S'




################
## 2: Age
# You’ll notice that a lot of the values in the Age column are missing. While there are many ways to fill these missing values, 
# using the mean or median of the rest of the values is quite common in such cases.
# Calculate the mean of the Age column and use that value to populate the missing values


# running code to see how many rows has NA.
length(which(is.na(titanicori$age)))

# making sure any missing values are assigned as NA
titanicori$embarked[titanicori$age==""]<- NA 

# running code to see if there were missing value after the last operation
length(which(is.na(titanicori$age)))

#calculate mean of the age column while ignoring NA's
mean(titanicori$age,na.rm = TRUE)

#setting up all NA to be the value of the mean
titanicori$age[is.na(titanicori$age)] <- 29.88113


# Think about other ways you could have populated the missing values in the age column. Why would you pick any of those over the mean (or not)?

range(titanicori$age)

### ANS : By finding the range of age of passanger, there are from 0.167 to 80. Hence, median would be an alternative choice as the range 
###       is not big and age distribution is quite even.




################
## 3: Lifeboat
# You’re interested in looking at the distribution of passengers in different lifeboats, but as we know, many passengers did not make it to a boat :-( 
# This means that there are a lot of missing values in the boat column. Fill these empty slots with a dummy value e.g. NA


# making sure any missing values are assigned as NA
titanicori$boat[titanicori$boat==""]<- NA 

# running code to see how many rows has NA.
length(which(is.na(titanicori$boat)))





################
## 4: Cabin
# You notice that many passengers don’t have a cabin number associated with them. Does it make sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value?
# What does a missing value here mean?

## Ans :  No, as the passenger class are separated into 3 different class, hence by allocating random values it will affect our final relationships
##        studies which will produce a flawed report. The missing values means that the ship staff were not effective in their job as some passangers 
##        managed to entered the ship illegally and they were not recorded.


# You have a hunch that the fact that the cabin number is missing might be a useful indicator of survival.
# Create a new column has_cabin_number which has 1 if there is a cabin number, and 0 otherwise.


#saves 'cabin' column value in new variable
cabinres <- titanicori$cabin;

#assigns value to a new column variable
has_cabin_number <- NULL

#vector produces a vector of the given length and mode.
has_cabin_number <- vector(mode="character", length=length(cabinres))


#replaces value with digits with 1 & missing value with 0
i <- 1;
for(cabinn in cabinres)         ## cabinn is created for the purpose of this for loop
{
  ifelse(grepl("[[:digit:]]+", cabinn) , 
         has_cabin_number[i] <- "1",
         ifelse(grepl("", cabinn),
                has_cabin_number[i] <- "0",
                )
         );
  i <- i + 1;
}

## add column to the data set
titanicori$has_cabin_number <-  has_cabin_number





################
## 6: Submit the project on Github
# Include your code, the original data as a CSV file titanic_original.csv, 
# and the cleaned up data as a CSV file called titanic_clean.csv.


# making sure the titanicori is a data frame
is.data.frame(titanicori)

# writing a new csv file after titanicori
write.csv(titanicori,file = "titanic_clean.csv" )
