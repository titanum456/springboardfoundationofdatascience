## what is the typical table range for majority of diamonds of ideal cut?
# Ans is 53 to 57

## what is the typical table range for majority of diamonds of premium cut?
# Ans is 58 to 61



# Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs. volume (x * y * z) and color the points by
# the clarity of diamonds. Use scale on the y-axis to take the log10 of price. You should also
# omit the top 1% of diamond volumes from the plot.
# Note: Volume is a very rough approximation of a diamond's actual volume.
# The plot should look something like this. http://i.imgur.com/excUpea.jpg
# Note: In the link, a color palette of type 'div' was used to color the scatterplot using
# scale_color_brewer(type = 'div')

diamonds <- diamonds %>% mutate(volume = x * y * z)

ggplot(aes(x = volume,y = price),data = subset(diamonds, volume < quantile(volume,probs = 0.99))) +

## Many interesting variables are derived from two or more others. For example, we might wonder how 
## much of a person's network on a service like Facebook the user actively initiated. Two users
## with the same degree (or number of friends) might be very different if one initiated most of those connections on the
## service, while the other initiated very few. So it could be useful to consider this proportion of existing friendships that
## the user initiated. This might be a good predictor of how active  a user is compared with their peers, or other traits, such as
## personality (i.e., is this person an extrovert?).

## Your task is to create a new variable called 'prop_initiated' in the Pseudo-Facebook data set. The variable should contain
## the proportion of friendships that the user initiated.

pf <- read.delim('pseudo_facebook.tsv')

names(pf)

pf$prop_initiated <- pf$friendships_initiated/pf$friend_count





## Create a line graph of the median proportion of friendships initiated ('prop_initiated') vs.
## tenure and color the line segment by year_joined.bucket.
## Recall, we created year_joined.bucket in Lesson 5 by first creating year_joined from the variable tenure.
## Then, we used the cut function on year_joined to create four bins or cohorts of users.
## (2004, 2009], (2009, 2011], (2011, 2012], (2012, 2014]
## The plot should look something like this. http://i.imgur.com/vNjPtDh.jpg
## OR this http://i.imgur.com/IBN1ufQ.jpg

pf <- pf %>% mutate(year_joined = floor(2014 - pf$tenure/365))

head(pf)

pf$year_joined.bucket <- cut(pf$year_joined, c(2004,2009,2011,2012,2014))

ggplot(aes(x =tenure, y = prop_initiated),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(year_joined.bucket))) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket), stat = 'summary' ,fun.y = median)  





## Smooth the last plot you created of of prop_initiated vs tenure colored by year_joined.bucket.
## You can bin together ranges of tenure or add a smoother to the plot.
## There won't be a solution image for this exercise.  You will answer some questions about your plot in the next two exercises.

ggplot(aes(x =tenure, y = prop_initiated),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(year_joined.bucket))) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket), stat = 'summary' ,fun.y = median) + geom_smooth()





## On average, which group initiated the greatest proportion of its facebook friendships? The plot with the 
## smoother that you created in the last exercise can help you answer this question? 

# Answer is people who joined after 2012. 


## For the group with the largest proportion of friendships initiated, what is the group's average proportion of friendships initiated? 

x <- subset(pf, year_joined.bucket == "(2012,2014]")
mean(x$prop_initiated,na.rm = TRUE)
# Answer is 0.665


## why do u think this group's proportion of friendships is initiated is higher than the others?

# The answer is they are new to the site hence they add most mutual friends instantly upon signing up.


## Create a scatter plot of the price/carat ratio of diamonds. The variable x should be assigned to cut. 
## The points should be colored by diamond color, and the plot should be faceted by clarity.
## The plot should look something like this. http://i.imgur.com/YzbWkHT.jpg.
## Note: In the link, a color palette of type 'div' was used to color the histogram using scale_color_brewer(type = 'div')

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price/carat)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color= color)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ clarity) +
  scale_color_brewer(type = 'div')



## The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about the world's population. Your task is to continue the investigation you did at the
## end of Problem Set 4 or you can start fresh and choose a different data set from Gapminder.
## If youâ€™re feeling adventurous or want to try some data munging see if you can find a data set or scrape one from the web.
## In your investigation, examine 3 or more variables and create 2-5 plots that make use of the techniques from Lesson 5.
## You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.
## Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
## 1. the variable(s) you investigated, your observations, and any summary statistics
## 2. snippets of code that created the plots, 3. links to the images of your plots
